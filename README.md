# The Amogus 3D enhanced Web Browser Chat

Hey! This project is just a little fun experiment for me, to see whether or not it is possible to create a multiplayer game in the web browser.

This project is still ongoing. You can check out what I'm trying to do currently in the `project` tab on `github` (propably).

If you'd like to see this project working yourself, you just have to run the `nodejs` server, which is in the `./nodejs_server/` directory.

That's only for now, as it's possible I'll move to something like `go`.
