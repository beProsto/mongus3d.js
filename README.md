# The Amogus 3D enhanced Web Browser Chat

Hey! This project is just a little fun experiment for me, to see whether or not it is possible to create a multiplayer game in the web browser.

This project is still ongoing. You can check out what I'm trying to do currently in the `project` tab on `github` (propably).

If you'd like to see this project working yourself, you just have to write your server's IP into the `ip` file and run the `go` server (for which you need to have [go](https://golang.org/) installed), which is in the `./go_server/` directory.

1. `cd go_server`
2. `go build`
3. `./go_server`

Big shoutout to @wawesomeNOGUI for making this project possible via his great [webrtcGameTemplate](https://github.com/wawesomeNOGUI/webrtcGameTemplate) repository. :D
