# The Amogus 3D Web Browser Video Game

Hey! This project is just a little fun experiment for me, to see whether or not it is possible to create a multiplayer mogus game in the web browser.

This project is still ongoing.

If you'd like to see this project working yourself, you just have to write your server's IP into the `ip` file and run the `go` server (for which you need to have [go](https://golang.org/) installed), which is in the `./go_server/` directory.

1. `cd go_server`
2. `go build`
3. `./go_server`

Big shoutout to [@wawesomeNOGUI](https://github.com/wawesomeNOGUI/) for making this project possible via his great [webrtcGameTemplate](https://github.com/wawesomeNOGUI/webrtcGameTemplate) repository. :D
